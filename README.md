# ESAM: Emergency Services Allocation Modelling

The first iteration of the Emergency Services Allocation Modelling software will focus on the development of a baseline forecasting model (BFM). 

The BFM, as an extension to ESAM, will provide a solid baseline for the development of the future, more mature, services allocation model. It is anticipated the baseline forecasting model will provide quantitative advice with regard to required annual staff resources allocations, in support of  business case proposals used by emergency services providers such as state and federal Police, Ambulance, and Fire Brigades.
