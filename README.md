# ESAM: Emergency Services Allocation Modelling

The first iteration of the Emergency Services Allocation Modelling software will focus on the development of a baseline forecasting model (BFM). 

The BFM, as an extension to ESAM, will provide a solid baseline for the development of the future, more mature, services allocation model. It is anticipated the baseline forecasting model will provide quantitative advice regarding optimal annual staff allocations, in support of business case proposals used by emergency services providers. ESAM and the BFM are intended to serve state and federal service providers, such as Police, Ambulance, and Fire Brigades, with a modern evidence based approach to staffing and resource allocation.
